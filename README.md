# Heart-Failure-Model
Classification Heart Failure Model
# Dataset description
from above columns we can identify that there are 12 attributes and 1 target column (death_event)

Age - age of the individual.

anaemia - a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues(False-0, true-1)

creatinine_phosphokinase - level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)

diabetes - If the person has diabetes or not (0- False , 1- True)

ejection_fraction - refers to how well your left ventricle (or right ventricle) pumps blood with each heartbeat (percentage)

high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (0- false, 1-True)

platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)

serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)

serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)

sex: 0-Female, 1- Male

smoking: 0-False, 1-True

time: follow-up period (days)

[target column] Death: do the person dies during the followup period.

the Objective here is to find out the solution or the behavior changes to be taken care to prevent the individual from suffering death from the top-most reason for the death(heart failure)
